## Description
This repository contains the developments of new addons for wow wotlk and cataclysm that I am currently developing. Also contains basic tutorial for LUA programming. Programming in LUA is necessary for the creation of addons.
The main objective of this repository is to teach the basics of wow addon programming, as well as the creation of three simple addons as an example.

</br>
</br>


## Useful tools for the development of addons:

IDE for Lua: https://studio.zerobrane.com

Code editor: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

Essential addons for debugging: Prat 3.0 and BugSack

</br>
</br>

## Structure of an addon

The addon folder must contain a TOC file and LUA files. The TOC file is what Wow looks for and reads when initializing the addon. Then, the TOC file contains the names of the addon files that will be executed, such as the Lua files.

## Phases of development :hammer:

- `Tutorials`: under construction. 
- `Addon 1: N24FirstAddon`: completed. Addon "Hello world", an introduction to variables, functions and events. It shows how to perform a "Hello World" using WOW's own variables, such as player name, and event variables such as user login events. In an easy way it shows how to print messages in the main chat.
- `Addon 2: N24StoringInformation`: under construction. Addon that teaches about information storage. This addon shows how to store information between sessions.
- `Addon 3: addon_name`: not started.
